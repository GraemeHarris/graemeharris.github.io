## This Site

I like to write things here to learn more about them. Ideally the pressure of some more eyes will make me dive deeper into new ideas. The structure might change but you can always assume the opinions are mine etc etc.

## Me

I've been tinkering with computer since I was a teen, making games and learning what makes them tick. I felt like I knew too many about the programming world and so went into electrical engineering, and then biomedical engineering. Ultimately I ended up back in front of the IDE - though I've never lost my passion for making electronics leak their magic smoke, I am always learning and stubbing my toe against reality.
